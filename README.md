## Overview
As part of the "Excel for Business: Advanced" course by Macquarie University, I undertook a challenging data cleaning assignment that was crucial for passing the course. This project involved transforming a dataset of 500 rows of extracted sales records from a messy and dirty state to a clean, structured, and analyzable format. The initial dataset was riddled with unwanted and unexpected characters, including unprintable characters. Leveraging my expertise in Microsoft Excel and using the ASCII system to diagnose and remove unprintable characters, I successfully completed this task, demonstrating a proficiency in data cleaning and management.
